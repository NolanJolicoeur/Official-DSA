### Fantasy Football Overview
```Markdown

* Fantasy Football is a game in which people face off head to head with fictional teams they created. 
* These teams are made up of real NFL athletes and the scoring system is based off actual NFL stats. 
  * Passing: 
    * Touchdown = 4 points
    * Yard = 0.04 points
  * Rushing: 
    * Touchdown = 6 points 
    * Yard = 0.1 points
  * Recieving: 
    * Touchdown = 6 points 
    * 1 Yard = 0.1 points 
    * Catch = 1 point

### Test 1 - Do Fantasy Points Relate to Wins?
```Markdown
* For this first test I summed the total fantasy points scored by each team throughout the season.

* Based on this graph, there seems to be a positive relationship between fantasy points and wins. 
* When using the Pearson correlation formula: 
     * Correlation = 0.7735
     * The 95 percent confidence interval is from 0.5817 to 0.8838. 
* There definitely seems to be a correlation between the two variables. 
* To try and find a stronger relationship, I next tested fantasy points in relation to points scored.

* This graph also has a positive relationship. 
* When using the Pearson correlation formula: 
     * Correlation = 0.8830
     * The 95 percent confidence interval is from 0.7720 to 0.9417. 
* The correlation between fantasy points and points for is stronger than the correlation between fantasy points and wins. 
* This means we can conclude that team fantasy points are a better predictor of points scored than wins.
